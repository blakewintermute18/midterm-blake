            <h2>Work for Fun</h2>
            <p>
                I will often find myself sucked into a project that while it is work,
                it is just so interesting that I am driven to complete it without any reward for its completion.
                For example, I first learned python because I was actually writing a Jython script to automate something on an Android phone.
                It was a difficult process since I didn't know any of the sintax, but I mussceled through it.

            <h2>Rowing Crew</h2>
            <p>
                I have been rowing crew for about 2 and half years at this point and its gotten only marginally easier.
                It is a lot of hard work, but when it is good it is great. Crew involves a lot of pain,
                and I have often asked myself why I do it sometimes I fail to come up with a response.
                But then I consider the person I was before. The lethargic, tired, slob who spent most of his time in bed.
                This is where I realize how much good it has done me.

            <h2>Video Games</h2>
            <p>
                While I don't have the time nor computing power to play games anymore, when I did my favorite game was Kerbal Space Program.
                There is no set object to the game rather you are given a sandbox of accurate physics and semi-realistic parts to create a space program.
                Through playing this game I gained a better intuition about physics.

            <h2>Interests</h2>
            <p>
                My main interest right now is Machine Learning.
                I have been doing it for a while, but there is just so much more I see others doing and want to get on board with.
                I have not yet touched LSTMs or any other type of RNN, so I would like to try working with that type of data.
