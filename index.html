            <h2>Current Life</h2>
            <p>
                I am currently a senior studing mostly STEM at Northfield Mount Hermon school.
                Through my life I have traveled greatly, and lived in many different situations.
                I've sailed the Caribbean seas, lived on a farm in the UK, and had a more or less normal life in the US.
                Growing up my father would always tell miraculous stories about adventures he had;
                that led me to stories are the greatest thing of value.
                That no matter what, if you get a good story out of it, it was worth it.
                This mentality has led me and my dad to do some rather questionably dangerous things, but I'll get to that.

            <h2>The Future (Hopefully)</h2>
            <p>
                I hope the future is bright. I have just recieved word that I was accepted as a QuestBridge Finalist.
                This improves my chances of getting into a top college significantly.
                Using QuestBridge I have "ranked" 5 schools I'll be applying to for early dsision.
                In college I hope to study either Physics, Computer Science, something to do with space, or a combination or those.
                I don't plan at this time to go to graduate school.
                This is mainly because I want to start doing something with my life,
                and not spend so much time just studing the lessons of others.
